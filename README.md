# FireWatch

The inspiration behind this project stems from the recent and devastating wildfires in Hawaii and Kelowna, BC where thousands have been displaced from their homes and have lost their culturally rich communities. Seeing this on the news absolutely broke our hearts,
and even though we couldn’t do anything directly to make an impact, we believed we could still save lives by providing vital information and updates about wildfire news to local leaders whilst also instilling educated tips into the public’s eyes through our application
FireWatch. Throughout the process, we were able to develop a variety of skills. Before this hackathon, neither of us had ever made a website, which required both of us to learn languages such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Being able to create a project really helped
us advance our practical knowledge of the frameworks of the following languages. To build the project, we utilized these newfound HTML, JavaScript, and CSS skills to combine our ideas into an application. The biggest challenges we faced as first time hackers,
and first time web-development programmers was the ability to complete our project within the time constraint. As a result, we weren’t able to fully integrate features such as live wildfire maps and updated news based on the regions. The lack of knowledge working with
API’s became a challenge when trying to complete these parts of our program, ultimately forcing us to hardcode it all together. However, overall being part of this hackathon gave us a brilliant opportunity to learn new programming languages and deploy our skills to
solve real life problems.
