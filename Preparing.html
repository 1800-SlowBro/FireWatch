                Emergency Kit<br>
                Having an emergency kit is integral, typically when without basic supplies or electricity.<br>
                Make sure to gather supplies such as:<br>
                - Food (Preferably packed foods that won't spoil)<br>
                - Water (4 liters per person/ per day)<br>
                - Battery operated/ wind-up flashlight<br>

                - Radio<br>
                - Knife<br><br>

                Educating The People Around You<br>
                Make sure the members of your household are informed:<br>
                - Have an emergency plan and emergency kit available to you<br>
                - Watch out for weather conditions in your area and look for weather advisories in your area<br>
                - Educate yourself on local evacuation routes & procedures and reach out to the local government<br>

                - Remove fire hazards such as leaves and branches around your home<br>
                - Have a working sprinkler in an accessible position<br>
                - Working fire alarms<br>

                - Leave animals unsheltered<br><br>

                Other Considerations<br>
                - Know how to turn off the utilities in your home<br>
                - Ensure vehicles have fuel if evacuation needed<br>
